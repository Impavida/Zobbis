# ZobbisApp

ZobbisApp is a private software project focused on building a reliable foundation
for real-world human interaction.

At its core, Zobbis provides a private messaging infrastructure designed deliberately
without social-network mechanics. The messaging layer itself is not the product,
but a supporting system that enables meaningful, real-world encounters.

---

## Core Idea

**Meet instead of typing.**

Zobbis is not a social network.
Digital communication is treated strictly as a tool — not as a destination.

The system exists to help coordinate real, spontaneous, and private encounters
in a controlled and temporary manner.

---

## Project Focus

- Private, purpose-driven message exchange
- Explicit multi-device support with clear device separation
- Clear separation of application, backend, and protocol layers
- Explicit design decisions over implicit convenience
- Minimalism, purpose limitation, and privacy-aware design

---

## Repository Structure (Overview)

- `ZobbisApp/` – Mobile application (React Native)
- `Backend/` – Server backend (Node.js / TypeScript)
- `packages/protocol/` – Shared protocol and contract definitions
- `ZobbisMapServer/` – Experimental auxiliary service
- `patches/` – Project-specific fixes and overrides

---

## Configuration & Handling

- Sensitive material (such as secrets, tokens, or keys) is not part of this repository
- Configuration is handled via environment variables or platform-specific secure storage
- The repository history has been reviewed prior to any potential publication

---

## Development Status

Active development.

The messaging foundation is built first and must reach a stable and well-defined
state before additional domains or features are considered.

---

## Access

This repository is currently **private**.
Access is granted explicitly and intentionally.
